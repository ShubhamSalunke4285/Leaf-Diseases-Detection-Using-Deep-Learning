# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based image classification system to detect plant leaf diseases. This project leverages CNN architectures like **VGG16**, **MobileNet**, **GoogleNet** and **VGG19** to accurately classify various leaf conditions from images. Built with Python and TensorFlow, the system is designed to assist farmers, agronomists, and researchers in early identification of crop diseases.
